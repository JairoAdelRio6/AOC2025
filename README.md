# Advent of Code (2025)

Solutions for [Advent of Code (2025)](https://adventofcode.com/2025), written using [Lua 5.4](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/) and [LPEG](https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/).

## Why?

I just wanted to prove myself complex programming puzzles can be solved by using a bare-bones programming language and a minimum of features. Also, I love Lua.

## Contribution

Code may be sloppy, not very aesthetic, and not optimized at all. Code comments are missing, too. So, any educated comment or suggestion to improve solution scripts will be gladly discussed and incorporated. Thank you for your time!
